Every operating system has something called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long to
work on each task before switching, and what to switch to.

Done right, computers move so fluidly between their various responsibilities, they give the
illusion of doing everything simultaneously.

One of the first insights is that all the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't
spending doing it.

The programmers of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003.

The programmers’ counterintuitive solution was to replace this full ranking with a limited
number of priority “buckets.”

The system was less precise about what to do next but more than made up for it by spending
more time making progress.

So with your emails, insisting on always doing the very most important thing first could lead to a
meltdown.

Another insight that emerges from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most
prevalent features of modern life: interruptions.

The insight here is that there’s a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and
responsiveness.

These two principles are fundamentally in tension.

Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where we want to strike that balance.

In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement in laptop battery life.
